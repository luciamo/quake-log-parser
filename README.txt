# Quake-log-parser

Quake-log-parser is a project to convert a Quake log into a readable report

## Installation

Use the npm for instalation and to start the project

```bash
npm install
```
```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

Just open the index.html file and open the console in your browser to see the magic happens. We, from Luciabo Tech, are sorry to inform that unfortunally, our main devs didn't had the time to implement a button so you can paste your own quake log and read its report so you are stuck with mine. Maybe if you give our a little more time we can make it happens. Shine a light and send it on
